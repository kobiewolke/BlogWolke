Code for test provided, the template provided was a it small so I tried to do as it was as far as I could see.

DB is located under the Entities, and the Web.Config for the API needs to change to accomodate the DB retored.

I used web API and MVC for the project, purely as this is what I use most often.
The Packages used were basic JQuery and Bootstrap, which allows for the responsiveness.

Also used the Json Soft package, for serializing and de-serializing of Data.

Due to loadshedding constraints I could not implement the Validation of the form...which I would've liked to add.

Thanks
